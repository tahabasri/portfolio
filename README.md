# portfolio

This my portfolio + resume (in markdown format).

Checkout the source files in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/tahabasri/portfolio/tree/gh-pages) branch.

## Resume
I opted for markdown as my resume format inspired by [markdown-cv](https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv). I use tweaked versions of stylesheets from the source repo.
