## Context

This article showcases how to implement Commerce Checkout (Cart-to-Order) in a headless context using a combination of B2B and D2C Commerce, Salesforce Payments, and Salesforce Commerce Payments APIs.

This niche use case may be necessary if the following business requirements apply:

- Implement a headless checkout process (not relying on store managed checkout).
- Use a saved payment method instead of capturing payment details during checkout.

## Notes

- A fully headless checkout with Salesforce Payments is not yet officially supported by Salesforce. This implementation presents a suggested solution based on personal experience with the Salesforce Payments capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Watch Salesforce Mojo's video about [Headless Commerce Checkout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqJ0FyMTs04).
- Salesforce Payments must be configured in the org with a valid Merchant Account and associated Payment Method Sets.
- Set up Postman with the required authentication details for the external store user.
- This process assumes that an active cart with existing Cart Item records already exists.

## Postman Collection

Import the following collection to access the APIs mentioned in this solution: [Headless Commerce APIs.postman_collection.json](https://salesforce-defacto.tahabasri.com/SalesforcePayments/HeadlessCommerceCheckoutWithSpm/assets/Headless%20Commerce%20APIs.postman_collection.json).

## Headless Commerce Checkout Process with Saved Payment Method (Salesforce Payments)

The following flow outlines the sequence of processes and API calls required to create an order from a cart. As mentioned in the notes section, the flow is not fully API-driven. Custom logic is introduced as a workaround after authorizing payment. This is necessary because the `checkouts/active/payments` API does not yet support Saved Payment Method records.

1. **Get Active Cart** — `GET` [Commerce Webstore Cart](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/salesforce-commerce/references/comm-cart-ref?meta=getCartSummary)
2. **Start Checkout** — `POST` [Commerce Webstore Checkouts](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.chatterapi.meta/chatterapi/connect_resources_commerce_webstore_checkouts_start_checkout.htm)
3. **Check Asynchronous Checkout Status** — `GET` [Commerce Webstore Checkout](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.chatterapi.meta/chatterapi/connect_resources_commerce_webstore_checkouts.htm)
   - During the asynchronous checkout process (e.g., calculating shipping, taxes, promotions), GET requests return a 202 status. When processing is complete, requests return a 200 status with up-to-date data.
4. **Update Checkout Details** — `PATCH` [Commerce Webstore Checkout](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.chatterapi.meta/chatterapi/connect_resources_commerce_webstore_checkouts.htm)
   - Must include data for only one sub-resource per call, such as contact information, shipping details, or delivery method.
5. **Get Store Application Context** — `GET` [Commerce Webstore Application Context](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.chatterapi.meta/chatterapi/connect_resources_commerce_webstore_application_context.htm)
   - Goal is to retrieve the `paymentMethodSetDevName`.
6. **Retrieve Payment Method Sets Information** — `GET` [Get Payment Method Sets By Dev Or MerchantAccountId](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/salesforce-commerce/references/comm-payments-ref?meta=getPaymentMethodSetsByDevOrMerchantAccountId)
   - Extra permissions: `Authenticated Payer` permission set.
   - Goal is to retrieve the `gatewayId`.
7. **Authorize Payment** — `POST` [Authorize Payment](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/salesforce-commerce/references/comm-ccs-payments-ref?meta=authorizePayment)
   - `paymentGroup.sourceObjectId` can be empty, as it will be populated after the order is placed. `paymentMethod.id` references the Saved Payment Method ID.
8. **Update Checkout Payment Information** — custom logic
   - Extra permissions: custom WebCart permissions.
   - Custom logic updates `WebCart.PaymentMethodId` and `WebCart.PaymentGroupId`. These fields may not be updatable by external users due to license/sharing restrictions. Options for implementation include Composite API, Flows, or Apex.
9. **Place Order** — `POST` [Commerce Webstore Checkout Orders](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.chatterapi.meta/chatterapi/connect_resources_commerce_webstore_checkouts_place_order.htm)
